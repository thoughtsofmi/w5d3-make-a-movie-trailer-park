// Make an object named spaceship1 using a JavaScript object literal. Include properties with this information: - Top speed of 2lyph (light years per hour) - Ship name of Galaxy Cruiser
//
// Include a method (a property that is set to an anonymous function) named launch that console logs your ship name + ' launching to infinity and beyond at ' + top speed + '!'. After you create your spaceship object, call the launch method to see the console log.
//
// Make three other spaceships with different speeds and names using the three other ways of making objects seen in the examples above.
var spaceShip1 = {
    topSpeed: 21yph
    shipName: GalaxyCruiser
}
    launch function(){
        console.log(shipName + ' launching to infinity and beyond at ' + topSpeed + '!.')
